--------------------------

The scanner will only pick up numbers including decimals, so
it is ok to leave text in a level for note keeping.

HOWEVER, do NOT add extra lines within a wave. Before/after a wave is fine.

All enemy delays are based on the start of the wave, NOT the
last delay.

Difficulty roughly corresponds to seconds it takes to chase/kill enemy, assuming no upgrades.
